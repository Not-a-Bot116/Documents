# Terminology

## Basic

### ACE

1. Ammunition, Casualties, Equipment  
- A short verbal report giving the status of yourself or your team. Commonly used at the team/squad level to quickly relay combat capability of a unit. 
- Ammunition:
    - <span style="color:red">1 Firefight</span>
    - <span style="color:#999900">2 Firefights</span>
    - <span style="color:green">3+ Firefights</span>
- Casualties:
    - <span style="color:red">Not combat capable (<45%)</span>
    - <span style="color:#999900">Combat capability degraded (55%-75%)</span>
    - <span style="color:green">Ready for combat (75%-100%)</span>
- Equipment
    - <span style="color:red">Out of mission critical equipment</span>
    - <span style="color:#999900">Low on mission critical equipment</span>
    - <span style="color:green">Good on mission critical equipment</span>
2. Advanced Combat Environment (Arma 3 Mod)
- The awesome mod that we use.

### Target vs Contact 
1. Target 
- A hostile enemy. This term is used to note that a hostile is located in a particular direction/distance from the team.

2. Contact 
- A call for engagement by the enemy. Contact is the natural progression of a target who has become hostile to the unit or friendlies. 

### ROE 
1. Rules of Engagement 
- Rules defined, usually based on the Area of Operations and spcific mission requirements, which layout the who/what/when/where/why of how combat will be conducted by BLUFOR. 
- Without specific briefs, ROE should be that targets should meet the threat triangle before engagement.

2. Threat Triangle 
- A target must have capability (They possess a weapon).
- A target must have the ability (Their weapon can cause harm to you at their engagement range).
- A target must have intent (They must show their intent by actively attempting to point/raise the weapon at you or friendlies).

### ADD
1. Alert, Direction, Distance
A quick verbal warning given to all members, usually over a radio indicating a hostile contact spotted. 
- Examples:
    - "4 man patrol, SouthEast, 100 meters moving toward us!"
    - "2 technicals, barting 283, 500 meters and closing!"
    - "Contact! Squad, East, distance close!" 
- Key points:
    - Don't use "to my right" or "behind me". That can get confusing. Use cardinal directions, or bearings. Whichever is more appropriate. 
    - Announce over the appropriate means. If you are near everyone who would be able to engage, yell through local voice. If your entire squad is spread out, take the line and announce contact quickly.
    - In the event contact is called out, everyone should relay that callout in local chat to everyone near them. 

### 360 Degree security 
    - A concept in which an entire unit will ensure that at all times 360 degrees around them is covered by someone from the unit.
    - This is to ensure that any potential contacts or targets can be spotted quickly and efficiently.

### Waypoints / Rallypoints / Vehicle Rallypoints 
1. Waypoint
- A specific location in the Area of Operations which the unit is supposed to travel through. Set generally at mission start and throughout as needed. 

2. Rallypoint
- A specific location denoted as being the point to fall back to should everything go wrong. This pre-designated point will be the defacto waypoint in case of adverse contact which causes confusion/disorginization (radios become jammed, an ambush happens and the unit retreats, etc.). This location is understood by ALL team members as the place to go to when thing go wrong.
3. Vehicle Rallypoint
- A location where a convoy pre-determines to disembark from vehicles to continue a patrol on foot.
- Typically out of audio range of targets and in a concealed location.
